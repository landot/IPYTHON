    "Make sure the following libraries load correctly (hit Ctrl-Enter). Note that while you are loading several powerful libraries, including machine learning libraries, the goal of this problem set is to implement several algorithms from scratch. In particular, you should *not* be using any built-in libraries for nearest neighbors, distance metrics, or cross-validation -- your mission is to write those algorithms in Python! Part 1 will be relatively easy; Part 2 will take more time.\n",

This will help you become familiar with techniques for maintaining fine-grained control over your data visualizations. It will also help our graders, who spent countless hours trying to make various versions import for grading."

Since this is a small dataset, you can simply compare your test instance to every instance in the training set, and return the MEDV value of the closest training instance.

Compute the RMSE of that particular test set, then move on to the next iteration.  Report the average RMSE across the 10 iterations."

For extra credit, implement a basic [forward selection](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/teach/643w04/lec/node41.html) algorithm to progressively include features that decrease the cross-validated RMSE of the model. Note that the optimal value of K may be different for each model, so you may want to use cross-validation to choose K each time (but it is also fine if you fix K at the optimal value from 2.7).  Create a graph that shows RMSE as a function of the number of features in the model. Label each point on the x-axis with the name of the feature that is added at that step in the forward selection algorithm. *(For instance, if the optimal single-feature model has CRIM with RMSE = 10, and the optimal two-feature model has CRIM+ZN with RMSE=9, the first x-axis label will say CRIM and the second x-axis lable with say ZN)*"
